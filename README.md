  3. ShoppingCart: Represents and stores ice cream orders in a cart using a regular Java array as its underlying storage.
  4. IceCreamStore: Stores a ShoppingCart and interacts with the customer through a set of predefined menus. The main menu 
                    displayed by IceCreamStore provides options that allow customers to print, price, or revise the ice cream 
                    orders in their cart, or to add new orders to or remove existing orders from their cart.
